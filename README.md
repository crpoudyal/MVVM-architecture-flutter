# MVVM Architecture in Flutter

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture in a Flutter application. It utilizes the Provider package for state management, SharedPreferences for handling user sessions, and includes error handling mechanisms. The application interacts with APIs using GET and POST requests.


## Features

- **MVVM Architecture**: Implements a clear separation between the UI, business logic, and data layers.
- **State Management**: Utilizes the Provider package for efficient state management.
- **User Session Handling**: Manages user sessions using SharedPreferences.
- **API Integration**: Supports GET and POST requests to interact with external APIs.
- **Error Handling**: Includes mechanisms to handle potential exceptions gracefully.
